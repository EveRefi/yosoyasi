                <p> My name is Evelyn I'm a chilean woman, that decided to get out of my confort zone, quit my job and move to UK.<br>
                    Live in UK it's been my dream since I was a teenager, when I arrived to Manchester I already got a job offer, so thngs were not that complicates, however It wasn't easy to find a place to live.<br>
                    I'm currently in the process to move house for 4th time in 20 months, crazy! "I know", hopefully this time will last longer than the previous places.<br>
                    Even though I like my curret job, I've always been curious about technology, and I love learn new thing and challenges, that's why I decided I want to become in a software developer.<br>

                        As we are growing up taste change, I can't believe how much I've changed in the last few years.<br>
